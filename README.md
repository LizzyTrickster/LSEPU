Lizzy's Solder-Enabled Pack Updater
======

This project aims to bring solder-integration to MC Launchers other than the Technic Launcher.
The main target is MultiMC but this should be able to be used anywhere.


This is loosely based on 
[SuPeRMiNoR2](https://github.com/SuPeRMiNoR2)'s [SSDeploy](https://github.com/SuPeRMiNoR2/ssdeploy) script, but designed
to be able to be used to keep servers up to date (like SSDeploy) but also allow for clients to utilise solder integration.
